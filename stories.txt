New Features:
- launching a run configuration is quite common - make it an action
- add menu items
- do some plugin namespacing
- embed webserver for web activated actions - ie. RunFit ...
- put shortcuts into a pmip namespace

Tidy Up:
- fix core internal naming (rubyify)
- make build be for java intellij's right now
- introduce result adapter (onSingle, onMultiple, onNone etc)

Ongoing:
- make it work in RubyMine - DataKeys are the current problem
- find a way to describe actions - in particular the context in which they can be used
- speed up file searching on windows - ideally use intellij index
- support intellij 9
- blow up if pmip already has shortcut - or at least print something out
- create build script for core plugin build
- fix plugin image on website, or remove somehow
- find a way to tidy up keymap state .. old stuff seems to be retained
- trap print(null) in host if it becomes problematic

Docs:
- write up plugin how to
- test write up plugin

Wasted:
- add capturing, based on earlier spike
